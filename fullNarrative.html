                    This narrative tries to highlight what's going on in our society today. Lost child pointing at a lot of young people trying to find themself. Always at the junction of making life-changing decisions. On the other hand, we have a drunken driver. Ponting
                    at the irresponsible manner of people who are in positions to be responsible.
                    <br />
                    <br /> Driving is a spot of being responsible, Now heâ€™s drunk I wonder what will happen to the lost child (hopes he gets lucky) at the junction of crossing the road.
